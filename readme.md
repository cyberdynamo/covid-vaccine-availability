## Features over official portal:

- More friendly with Mobile devices.
- **It does not show the unavailable slots/booked slots:** In Official portal unavailable slots/booked slots are being mixed with available slots making it difficult to lookup the entire data.
- Filters the available slots with a given date entered by user.
- **User can share available slots to other users:** Printing facility is available on top of the page, user can print and share the slots with other users via social plateforms. This will decrese traffic on Official portal.
- **Official portal doesn't show the Vaccine prices in PAID centers:** whereas in this portal one can view the Vaccine prices for PAID centers.
